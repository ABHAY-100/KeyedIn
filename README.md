## üîí About

Privy is where messages go when they don't want to be remembered. We've built an ephemeral messaging platform that takes privacy seriously - all communications are end-to-end encrypted and vanish completely after your conversation ends.

**Why would you use Privy?**
- When you need conversations that truly disappear
- For sharing sensitive information that shouldn't stick around
- When you want privacy without complexity

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Actually Ephemeral**: Messages vanish after your session ends or when you refresh - seriously, they're gone
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Everything's locked with PGP/RSA encryption that even we can't peek at
- **Zero Server Storage**: Your private keys stay on your device - where they belong
- **Smart Session Controls**:
  - 5 minutes of inactivity? You're logged out
  - 30 minutes total session time? That's all you get
  - Fresh encryption keys each time - because reusing keys is like reusing passwords
- **Just You Two**: Chat rooms are strictly limited to 2 participants
- **Fair Usage**: Maximum 10 sessions per IP (we want to keep the lights on for everyone)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### How We Handle Encryption

- **Your Keys, Your Device**: All keys are generated right in your browser
- **Nothing Leaves Home**: Private keys never leave your device - not even to us
- **Double-Locked Storage**: Private keys are AES-encrypted before even hitting SessionStorage
- **Extra Randomness**: We use parts of your browser fingerprint to strengthen encryption (not for tracking!)
- **Minimal Sharing**: Only public keys get exchanged between chat participants

### Browser & Network Protections

- **Content Security Policy**: We lock down what can run in your browser
- **Clickjacking Protection**: No one can trick you into clicking things you didn't mean to
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: HSTS headers keep your connection encrypted
- **Secure Sockets**: Real-time chat happens over secure WebSocket connections

### How Sessions Work

- **Auto-Cleanup**: Sessions self-destruct after 30 minutes or when you step away
- **Private Conversations**: Only two people can join a room - no unexpected guests
- **Clean Slate**: When you're done, all keys and messages are completely wiped
- **Fair Usage**: Limits on concurrent sessions prevent abuse

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Gone Means Gone**: By design, there's no way to recover messages
- **Modern Browsers Only**: You'll need a browser with proper WebCrypto support
- **Not Perfect**: While message content is encrypted, connection timing might still reveal metadata
- **Know Your Risks**: Consider your threat model when using any privacy tool
