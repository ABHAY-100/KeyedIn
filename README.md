## üîí About

Privy is where messages go when they don't want to be remembered. We've built an ephemeral messaging platform that takes privacy seriously - all communications are end-to-end encrypted and vanish completely after your conversation ends.

**Why would you use Privy?**
- When you need conversations that truly disappear
- For sharing sensitive information that shouldn't stick around
- When you want privacy without complexity



## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Truly Ephemeral Communication**:
  - Messages and data vanish after 30 minutes or on page refresh
  - Auto-destruction after 5 minutes of inactivity
  - Fresh encryption keys generated for each session

- **End-to-End Encryption**:
  - PGP encryption for all message content
  - Your keys never leave your device
  - Messages stored encrypted in your browser only
  - No server-side data storage

- **Private By Design**:
  - Strictly 2 participants per chat room
  - Fair usage: maximum 10 sessions per IP address
  - No message content traces after conversations end



## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

### How We Handle Encryption

- **Your Keys, Your Device**: All keys are generated right in your browser
- **Double-Locked Storage**: Private keys are AES-encrypted with browser fingerprint data before storing in SessionStorage
- **Extra Randomness**: We use parts of your browser fingerprint to strengthen encryption (not for tracking!)
- **Minimal Sharing**: Only public keys get exchanged between chat participants
- **Secure Message Storage**: Messages encrypted and stored temporarily in browser's IndexedDB with additional safeguards

### Browser & Network Protections

- **Content Security Policy**: We lock down what can run in your browser
- **Clickjacking Protection**: No one can trick you into clicking things you didn't mean to
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: HSTS headers keep your connection encrypted
- **Secure Sockets**: Real-time chat happens over secure WebSocket connections
- **XSS Prevention**: DOMPurify sanitizes all content to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API request limits protect against brute force and DoS attacks

### How Sessions Work

- **Auto-Cleanup**: Sessions self-destruct after 30 minutes or when you step away for 5 minutes
- **Private Conversations**: Only two people can join a room - no unexpected guests
- **Clean Slate**: When you're done, all keys and messages are completely wiped
- **Fair Usage**: Limits on concurrent sessions prevent abuse

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **No Recovery**: Messages are permanently deleted by design - no recovery possible
- **Technical Requirements**: Requires modern browsers with WebCrypto API support
- **Privacy Limits**: While messages are encrypted, connection metadata remains visible
- **User Precautions**:
  - Consider using a VPN to mask your IP address
  - Use private browsing mode
  - Connect only through trusted networks
  - Ensure your device is secure and up-to-date

Remember to assess your specific threat model before using for highly sensitive communications.
